## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Typescript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project helped me become more comfortable with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and its utility-first approach to styling. It also deepened my understanding of Flexbox and Grid layout techniques.

### Continued development

I would like to continue practicing more complex layout techniques, especially working with Flexbox and Grid, and further improve my TypeScript skills.

### Useful resources
